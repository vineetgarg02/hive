--Restriction.11.m A SubQuery predicate that refers to a Parent Query column must be a valid Join predicate

--Restriction.13.m In the case of an implied Group By on a correlated Sub- Query, the SubQuery always returns 1 row. For e.g. a count on an empty set is 0, while all other UDAFs return null. Converting such a SubQuery into a Join by computing all Groups in one shot, changes the semantics: the Group By SubQuery output will not contain rows for Groups that donâ€™t exist.
